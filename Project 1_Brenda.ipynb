And, we want to loop i, and j seperately, we need two for loops, the first for loop, we iterate i, and we going to the second for loop with j, and we need a temperary number \"mult\", evetually, this number will be replaced by max_pal. so if str(mult) = reverse str(mult) then this is the number we are looking for, then we make max_pal = mult. Becasue number can't have reverse, so we use string(mult) to reverse the number. And at the end, we can print our final product, print(max_pal), we get 906609."
